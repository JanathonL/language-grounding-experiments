# emergence-of-natural-language
To do experiments on using multi-agent system to simulate the emergence of natural language

# Requirements

- [training-monitor](https://github.com/yzh119/training_monitor) (To visualize the training process)

## First Experiment
It's a simplified version of the [ICLR2017 paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.07182.pdf).

[More details](number-game/README.md)

## Second Experiment
